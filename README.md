### A Visual IDE for React Projects

Codux is an all-in-one visual development environment. Whether you’re starting a new app, creating components, or editing an existing project, every visual change you make reflects instantly in the code and vice versa. To learn more about Codux, visit our website - [https://www.codux.com/](https://www.codux.com/)

This application was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It includes a single React component to start your project with, a sample [`codux.config.json`](codux.config.json) with preconfigured keys, a `package.json` file to describe the project's packages and dependencies, and a folder and component structure to put everything neatly in its place.

- Edit, render and compose apps that make use of React-based components.
- Create React-based components with TypeScript, SCSS and CSS Modules support.
- Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.

### Development

The following scripts are available:

`npm run build` - Build the application in production mode into a folder named `dist`. This folder can be served using any HTTP server.

`npm start` - Start the application in **development** mode (and open the web browser).

`npm test` - Execute `typecheck` and `lint` scripts.

`npm run eject` - If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
